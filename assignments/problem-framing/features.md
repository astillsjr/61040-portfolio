# Assignment 1: Problem Framing 
## Part 5 – Features 

---

### Problem 1: *Starting is the Hardest Part*  
*(Failure to Start Tasks Early – Domain: Procrastination & Motivation)*

1. “First 5-Minute Starter” Nudges
At scheduled times, the app prompts you to do just the first 5 minutes of a task you've logged, with no pressure to complete it.  Research shows that reducing initiation friction (activation energy) for starting a task is crucial, and this feature builds momentum and lowers the mental cost of beginning.

2. “Micro-Bets” on Start Times
Users place small accountability bets (real or virtual points) on whether they’ll start a task by a certain time. Success earns streaks or unlocks rewards. This adds gamification and social incentive to behavior change, while additionally farming consistent engagement on the app.

3. “Task Emotion Logger”
Before and after each task, users log how they feel about the task. Over time, it visualizes emotional patterns and helps reframe tasks positively, as many procrastinate due to dread or fear of difficulty. This encourages self-awareness and shows that tasks often feel better after starting.

### Problem 2: *Travel Planning Chaos*
*(Scattered Travel Plans Across Apps – Domain: Organizing Group Travel)*

1. “All-in-One Shared Trip Board”
Central hub where group members can upload screenshots, links, schedules, and notes from any app (flights, hotels, texts). Automatically organizes info into a shared itinerary. This solves the core issue of fragmentation: no more flipping between Messages, Docs, and Booking.com.

2. “Decision Voting for Plans”
Members can create polls for key trip decisions (flights, Airbnb, activities), set deadlines, and see votes in real time. This reduces indecision and argument loops in group chats and ensures everyone has input without needing to sync schedules.

3. “Smart Plan Parser”
Automatically extracts trip details (times, dates, confirmation numbers) from screenshots, PDFs, or plain text. This helps with disorganized teammates who send hotel bookings via random screenshots or WhatsApp messages.

### Problem 3: *Falling Off the Learning Wagon*  
*(Inconsistent Learning Habits – Domain: Learning Through Micro-Challenges)*

1. “Daily 5-Minute Challenge”
Sends you a 5-minute microtask daily (e.g., one practice question, flashcard set, or review prompt), tailored to your subject. This keeps users engaged with low-friction, bite-sized learning, and builds habit loops without being overwhelming.

2. “Streak Garden” Visual Tracker
Visualizes progress as a growing garden or digital pet, and every day you complete a challenge, your tree grows. Miss a day? It wilts. This uses visual gamification and emotional investment to build consistency, similar to Habitica or Duolingo.

3. “Challenge Me” Buddy System
Allows you to pair with a friend or classmate and send/receive short daily challenges (can be competitive or cooperative). This adds accountability and social motivation, and builds study momentum through peer encouragement.
