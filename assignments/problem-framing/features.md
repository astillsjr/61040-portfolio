# Assignment 1: Problem Framing 
## Part 5 – Features 

---

### Problem 1: *Starting is the Hardest Part*  
*(Failure to Start Tasks Early – Domain: Procrastination & Motivation)*

1. “First 5-Minute Starter” Nudges
- What it does: At scheduled times, the app prompts you to do just the first 5 minutes of a task you've logged — no pressure to complete it. You get credit simply for starting.
- Why it helps: Research shows that reducing initiation friction (activation energy) is crucial. This feature builds momentum and lowers the mental cost of beginning.
- Stakeholders impacted: Students (primary user), professors (may receive better quality submissions), mental health counselors (reduced stress impact).

2. “Micro-Bets” on Start Times
- What it does: Users place small accountability bets (real or virtual points) on whether they’ll start a task by a certain time. Success earns streaks or unlocks rewards.
- Why it helps: Adds gamification and social incentive to behavior change. Based on the principle of commitment devices.
- Stakeholders impacted: Student; peers in study group (if collaborative); app platform (for engagement/retention).

3. “Task Emotion Logger”
- What it does: Before and after each task, users log how they feel about the task. Over time, it visualizes emotional patterns and helps reframe tasks positively.
- Why it helps: Many procrastinate due to dread or fear of difficulty. This encourages self-awareness and shows that tasks often feel better after starting.
- Stakeholders impacted: Student (self-reflection), therapists/counselors, productivity researchers.

### Problem 2: *Travel Planning Chaos*
*(Scattered Travel Plans Across Apps – Domain: Organizing Group Travel)*

1. “All-in-One Shared Trip Board”
- What it does: Central hub where group members can upload screenshots, links, schedules, and notes from any app (flights, hotels, texts). Automatically organizes info into a shared itinerary.
- Why it helps: Solves the core issue of fragmentation — no more flipping between Messages, Docs, and Booking.com.
- Stakeholders impacted: Travelers, trip organizers, travel agents.

2. “Decision Voting for Plans”
- What it does: Members can create polls for key trip decisions (flights, Airbnb, activities), set deadlines, and see votes in real time.
- Why it helps: Reduces indecision and argument loops in group chats. Ensures everyone has input without needing to sync schedules.
- Stakeholders impacted: Group members (direct users), lead planner (saves time), travel companions.

3. “Smart Plan Parser”
- What it does: Automatically extracts trip details (times, dates, confirmation numbers) from screenshots, PDFs, or plain text.
- Why it helps: Helps with disorganized teammates who send hotel bookings via random screenshots or WhatsApp messages.
- Stakeholders impacted: Organizer, all group members (accuracy & clarity).

### Problem 3: *Falling Off the Learning Wagon*  
*(Inconsistent Learning Habits – Domain: Learning Through Micro-Challenges)*

1. “Daily 5-Minute Challenge”
- What it does: Sends you a 5-minute microtask daily (e.g., one practice question, flashcard set, or review prompt), tailored to your subject.
- Why it helps: Keeps users engaged with low-friction, bite-sized learning. Builds habit loops without being overwhelming.
- Stakeholders impacted: Student, encourager (better long-term retention), platform (higher engagement).

2. “Streak Garden” Visual Tracker
- What it does: Visualizes progress as a growing garden or digital pet — every day you complete a challenge, your tree grows. Miss a day? It wilts.
- Why it helps: Uses visual gamification and emotional investment to build consistency. Similar to Habitica or Duolingo.
- Stakeholders impacted: Student, study groups (can compare gardens), app developer.

3. “Challenge Me” Buddy System
- What it does: Allows you to pair with a friend or classmate and send/receive short daily challenges — can be competitive or cooperative.
- Why it helps: Adds accountability and social motivation. Builds study momentum through peer encouragement.
- Stakeholders impacted: Students (both users), clubs/tutors/mentors.
