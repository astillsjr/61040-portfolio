## Selected Problems

### 1. Starting is the Hardest Part  
**(Domain: Procrastination & Motivation)**  
I find myself struggling to begin tasks early, even when I know they have the time. The hardest part is often just starting, as once the task is underway, it becomes easier for my to continue. Solving this issue could bring significant value by reducing stress and improving productivity without needing a complete overhaul of my workflow.

### 2. Travel Planning Chaos  
**(Domain: Organizing Group Travel)**  
Group travel planning often becomes a mess because information is scattered across many sourses (texts, shared docs, emails, and apps). When trying to keep track of who’s participating, where you're staying, what time your flights are, or who paid for what, it's easy to miss details. This problem is frustratingly common and solving it could bring clarity, efficiency, and enjoyment back to group trips.

### 3. Falling Off the Learning Wagon  
**(Domain: Learning Through Micro-Challenges)**  
I want to build new skills, but staying consistent is challenging. Life gets in the way, and my motivation can fade quickly at times. I don't want to miss out on the potential to learn new things and grow as a person if there is a way to make learning easier. 

## Unselected Problems 

- **Lack of accountability for personal goals**
While I do think this is imporatant, I struggle to imagine an effective way to create a sense of "accountabilty" for a user that wouldn't cause them to shy away from the app to begin with.  

- **Ineffective use of time tracking apps** 
This seems more like a UX issue than a behavior change issue, and could easily result in a generic productivity app clone.  

- **Coordinating availability among group members**
A problem that can be handled easily with a poll and use of a calendar, and doesn't seem worth it to create a whole new app for it by itself.  

- **Tracking shared costs and payments** 
Apps like Splitwise and/or Cashapp already cover this issue well enough, so the app may struggle to draw in an audience.

- **Lack of immediate feedback**
This issue may require a high technical scope for proper implementation (use of AI), which may be too much for the constraints of the class.   

- **Initial friction getting started** 
While this problem is important, tackling the main issue of staying consistent once starting seems more important than vice-versa.
