## Selected Problems

### 1. Starting is the Hardest Part  
**(Domain: Procrastination & Motivation)**  
Many students struggle to begin tasks early, even when they know they have the time. The hardest part is often just starting — once the task is underway, it becomes easier to continue. This problem resonates with me personally, and I believe it affects a wide range of people. Solving it could bring significant value by reducing stress and improving productivity without needing a complete overhaul of someone’s workflow.

### 2. Travel Planning Chaos  
**(Domain: Organizing Group Travel)**  
Group travel planning often becomes a mess because information is scattered across texts, shared docs, emails, and apps. When trying to keep track of who’s in, where you're staying, what time your flights are, or who paid for what, it's easy to miss details or duplicate work. This problem is frustratingly common and solving it could bring clarity, efficiency, and enjoyment back to group trips.

### 3. Falling Off the Learning Wagon  
**(Domain: Learning Through Micro-Challenges)**  
People want to build new skills, but staying consistent is tough — life gets in the way, and motivation fades quickly. This is especially true for self-learners trying to do something every day. Micro-challenges offer a lightweight, fun approach, but the real challenge is creating a habit. This problem is well-scoped, dynamic, and could lead to engaging features like streaks, reminders, or challenge history.

## Unselected Problems 

- **Lack of accountability for personal goals**  
Important, but overlaps heavily with the selected procrastination issue. Narrowing the focus to task initiation felt more actionable.

- **Ineffective use of time tracking apps**  
More of a UX or usability issue than a behavior change issue. Could turn into a generic productivity app clone.

- **Coordinating availability among group members**  
Already handled decently by tools like Doodle. The broader problem of scattered planning felt more original and comprehensive.


- **Tracking shared costs and payments** 
Apps like Splitwise cover this well. I prioritized the messier, less-addressed problem of fragmented information across tools.


- **Lack of immediate feedback**   
Interesting but could require AI-generated responses or grading — likely outside the technical scope of this course.


- **Initial friction getting started** 
Valid UX concern, but the long-term challenge of habit-building felt like a more dynamic and course-relevant issue.
