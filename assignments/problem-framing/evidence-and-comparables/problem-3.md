- [The efficacy of microlearning in improving self-care capability: a systematic review of the literature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32882481/): A systematic review that shows micro-learning can enhance self-care cognition.

- [The effect of micro-learning on learning and self-efficacy of nursing students: an interventional study](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-022-03726-8): A study that claims microlearning notably improved learning outcomes and self-efficacy among nursing students in controlled studies.

- [I replaced social media with 'micro-learning' for 30 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1i6e3uf/i_replaced_social_media_with_microlearning_for_30/): A student’s Reddit account shared an experiment replacing social media with 5–10 minute learning sessions, leading to better sleep, less anxiety, and increased focus.

- [7 ways students can retiam more in less time: The case for ending cramming sessions](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/7-ways-students-can-retain-more-in-less-time-the-case-for-ending-cramming-sessions/articleshow/123404247.cms): a study that shows research urges moving away from cramming toward strategies like microlearning, spaced repetition, active recall, interleaved practice, and consistent study routines to improve long-term retention.

- [ClueKeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClueKeeper): While not a direct micro-challenge app, ClueKeeper offers location-based, gamified puzzles that engage users episodically, with traces of micro-task design.

- [Writers Gonna Wait: The Effectiveness of Notifications to Initiate Aversive Action in Writing Procrastination](https://www.hrdive.com/news/microlearning-may-be-habit-forming-study-found/528852/): An article that states 75% engaged in microlearning two to three times per week, a clear indicator of habit formation.

- [The Problem With Procrastination](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544793.3560381): A 2022 experiment introduced “habit-attached microlearning,” where short learning tasks were inserted into users’ existing mobile habits (like web browsing). This reduced friction and encouraged sustainable learning engagement.

- [The Problem With Procrastination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10850): A reading-contest intervention in an educational app for children added a gamified structure with real rewards. One hundred days later, participants continued engaging at a rate 75% higher than those in the control group, with 6% higher retention.
