# Assignment 1: Problem Framing  
## Part 3 – Stakeholders

---

### Problem 1: *Starting is the Hardest Part*  
*(Failure to Start Tasks Early – Domain: Procrastination & Motivation)*

**Stakeholders:**
- **User** – A student or individual who has tasks to complete  
- **Evaluator** – A professor or manager who assesses the user's work  
- **Peer Collaborator** – A classmate or team member who works with the user  

**Impacts:**  
The user is directly harmed by stress, lower productivity, and reduced academic or personal performance. A good solution would help them start earlier and reduce anxiety. The evaluator often receives rushed or lower-quality work, which may not reflect the user’s potential. The peer collaborator may experience delays or frustration when procrastination affects shared tasks, leading to unfair workload distribution or missed deadlines.

### Problem 2: *Travel Planning Chaos*
*(Scattered Travel Plans Across Apps – Domain: Organizing Group Travel)*

**Stakeholders:**
- **Organizer** – The person coordinating the group travel logistics  
- **Traveler** – A friend or group member relying on the trip information  
- **Vendor** – Hotels, airlines, or Airbnb hosts who rely on clear group communication  

**Impacts:**
The organizer experiences stress and burnout trying to manage information spread across messages, documents, and booking platforms. Travelers may miss key details like departure times or addresses, leading to late arrivals or missed reservations. Vendors can be impacted by last-minute changes or unclear communication, which disrupts their planning and customer experience. 

### Problem 3: *Falling Off the Learning Wagon*  
*(Inconsistent Learning Habits – Domain: Learning Through Micro-Challenges)*

**Stakeholders:**
- **Learner** – Someone trying to build a new skill through daily practice
- **Encourager** – A teacher, mentor, or peer who wants to support the learner
- **Content Provider** – The creator or company offering learning content or an app

**Impacts:**
The learner may feel guilty, discouraged, or overwhelmed when they break their streak or miss multiple days, often leading to abandonment of the skill. The encourager may want to help but lacks effective tools to keep the learner motivated without micromanaging. Content providers want users to stay engaged long-term, but poorly designed reminders or lack of feedback loops can cause users to drop off entirely.
