### Selected Domains

1. Procrastination & Motivation

Procrastination is something that many people struggle with. We often know what needs to be done, but find it hard to get started until the deadline is close, which adds stress and reduces the quality of our work. This domain feels personally relevant, and I know many students and people in general experience the same issue. I beleive that there are factors (small nudges, tracking, or accountability) that could help reduce this behavior in a way that actually works.

2. Organizing Group Travel

Planning group trips with family and friends has been surprisingly difficult at times. Between figuring out who’s free when, agreeing on destinations, booking places to stay, and splitting costs, the process can easily become a mess. There's been many times where even simple group trips become overwhelming without a central place to organize details, and I think there’s a real opportunity to build a tool that makes this experience less stress-inducing.

3. Learning Through Micro-Challenges

As someone who is trying to learn new skills, I know how hard it is to stay consistent. The traditional learning methods can be boring or overwhelming, and I feel like micro-challenges (short, fun, focused tasks) help make progress feel more achievable. I think an app that helps people build a creative or technical skill in potentially just a few minutes a day holds real value.
