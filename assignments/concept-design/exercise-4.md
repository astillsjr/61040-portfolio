# Problem Set 1: Reading and Writing Concepts
## Exercise 4: Defining familiar Concepts

---

### Concept 1

**concept** UrlShortener
**purpose** shorters exisiting URLs to make them easier to use
**principle**
  a user submits submits a longer URL and recieves a shorter one (either user-defined or autogenerated); 
  a user can deactivate the shortened URL so nobody can use it anymore; 
**state**
  a set of ShortenedURLs with 
    an originalURL String
    an active Flag
  a set of UserDefinnedSuffixes
**actions**
  createShortURl (originalURL: String, userDefinedSuffix?: String): (shortenedURL: String)
    **requires** userDefinedSuffix (if provided) is not already used 
    **effects** create a new active shortened URL with the given userDefinedSuffix if provided, otherwise uses an autogenerated suffix

  deactivateShortURL (shortenedURL: String)
    **requires** the provided shortened URL exists and is active
    **effects** sets the active flag for the specified shortened URL to false

  getOriginalURL (shortURL: String): (originalURL: string)
    **requires** the provided shortenedURL exists
    **effects** returns the original URL associated with the shorted URL


### Concept 2

**concept** BillableHoursTracking [User]
**purpose** automate the tracking of billable hours for employees working on client projects
**principle**
  employees start a session by selecting a project and entering a breif description of the work;
  at the end of the session, they stop the timer and finalize their time entry; the end time of a 
  session can be modified in case of failure at properly ending a session. 
**state**
  a set of Users with
    a set of Sessions
  a set of Sessions with 
    a project String
    a description String
    a start time Date
    an end time Date
    an ongoing Flag
**actions**
  startSession (user: User, project: String, description: String): (session: Session)
    **requires** user already exists
    **effects** creates a new session with the given project name and description and sets the start time to the current system clock time

  endSession (user: User, session: Session)
    **requires** the provided session is associated with the user and is currently ongoing
    **effects** sets the ongoiong flag of the session to false and sets the end time to the current system clock time

  editSession (user: User, session: Session, newProjectName?: String, newDescription?: string, newEndTime?: Date)
    **requires** the provided session is associated with the user
    **effects** updates the given session with the provided information

### Concept 3

**concept** ConferenceRoomBooking [User, Room]
**purpose** ensures the availability of conference rooms and prevents double-booking
**principle**
  a user reserves a conference room for a particular duration, and then can be assured that the
  room is available for that time frame
**state**
  a set of Dates with
    a set of Bookings
  a set of Bookings with 
    a user User
    a room Room
    a name String
    a start time Time
    a duration Time
**actions**
  createBooking (user: User, date: Date, location: Room, name: String, startTime: Time, duration: Time): (booking: Booking)
    **requires** there is no conflicting booking at the given date, location, and start time
    **effects** creates a booking at the specified date 

  editBooking (booking: Booking, newDate?: Date, newLocation?: Room, newName?: String, newStartTime?: Time, newDuration?: Time): (updatedBooking: Booking)
    **requires** the provided booking exisits and the resulting modified booking does not conflict with existing bookings
    **effects** modifies the provied booking with the new provided parameters

  cancelBooking (date: Date, booking: Booking)
    **requires** the provided booking already exists
    **effects** removes the specified booking from the set of bookings at the given date
