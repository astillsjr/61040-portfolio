## Part 1 – Problem Statement

### Procrastination & Motivation

Procrastionation is a widespread issue that affects people's productivity. Whether it’s putting off important work or delaying personal projects, the struggle to get started can create stress, missed opportunities, and hinder personal growth. Motivation is often the key to overcoming procrastination, but it’s hard to maintain motivation consistently, especially when the task feels overwhelming or mundane. I’ve personally experienced the challenges of procrastination and have realized that the hardest part for me is overcoming that initial hesitation in starting a task.

### Struggling to Start Tasks Early

Despite having the time and resources, many people struggle with the simple act of starting a task, especially when it seems daunting. The challenge of getting started can lead to unnecessary stress, procrastination, and missed deadlines, which ultimately affects productivity and personal well-being. This problem is not just about lacking willpower; it’s often about overcoming the mental block that comes with initiating tasks. Once people begin, they typically find that the task is easier to continue, but the starting point is the hardest. This problem is especially relevant in academic and professional settings where time management is crucial. Solving this problem can lead to a smoother workflow, less anxiety about deadlines, and greater overall satisfaction with one’s productivity.
