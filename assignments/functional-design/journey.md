A user has a 2000-word research paper due in four days, but they have not written a word. They've known about the dealine for a week, but every time they think about starting, they feel overwheled. The user opnes the Nudger app, taps on the *create new task* button and logs the details of the assignment. As soon as they log the task, the app's NudgeEngine create a nugde for 9:55 AM the next day. To hold themselves accountable, the user moves to the bets page and places a large wager of all their currency on finishing the assignment.
