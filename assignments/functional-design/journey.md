A user has a 2000-word research paper due in four days, but they have not written a word. They've known about the dealine for a week, but every time they think about starting, they feel overwheled. The user opnes the Nudger app, taps on the *create new task* button and logs a task "write the intro for the paper". As soon as they log the task, the app's NudgeEngine create a nugde for 9:55 AM the next day. To hold themselves accountable, the user moves to the bets page and places a large wager of all their currency on starting the assignment by 10:00 AM. They really want to keep their productivity streak going.  

At 9:55 AM the next day, they get a notification: "Just do 5 minutes of your paper. Don’t worry about finishing." The message is low-pressure, just what they need. The bet also adds a small sense of urgency. Before starting, the app prompts her to log how they feel (dread), and afterwards they start typing a rough intro. After 40 minutes, they stops writing, not only did they finish the intro, but they outlined the next section too. They marks the task as complete. The app prompts them to log how they feel (motivated). Their micro-bet is marked as a success and their total points are doubled and their streak is extended. 

Later that week, the user checks their Emotional Trends page. They notice that most tasks they dread leave them feeling motivated after starting. This insight helps reframe how they view “hard” tasks.
