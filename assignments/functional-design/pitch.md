## Part 2 – Application Pitch

### Nudgr 

Nudgr is designed to help users overcome the mental block of starting tasks: through personalized nudges, small time commitments, and progress tracking, it encourages users to take the first step, turning daunting tasks into manageable actions.

### Key Features

**1. Personalized Nudges**  
At scheduled or context-aware times, the app prompts users to do just the *first few minutes* of a task they've logged (e.g., "just start for 3 minutes"). These nudges are intentionally low-pressure and designed to overcome task initiation resistance. Research in behavioral psychology shows that the biggest hurdle in productivity is often just getting started. This feature lowers the “activation energy” required to begin, helping users build momentum without pressure to complete the task. For users, this reduces stress and builds confidence. 

**2. “Micro-Bets” on Start Times**  
Users can place small “bets” (real or virtual currency/points) on whether they will start a task at a specific time. Succeed, and you earn streaks, points, or unlock rewards. Fail, and the points go to a "productivity pool" or reset your streak. This adds gamification and accountability, which are two powerful motivators. Even symbolic stakes can make users more likely to follow through, and the system encourages frequent, deliberate engagement with their task list. Users benefit from a playful but effective motivational boost, while developers gain consistent user engagement.

**3. “Task Emotion Logger”**  
Before and after starting a task, users quickly log their emotional state (e.g., “dreading,” “anxious,” “neutral,” “motivated”). Over time, the app visualizes trends and shows how feelings shift once action is taken. Many people procrastinate because they feel a task will be unpleasant, even if that isn’t true. Seeing emotional patterns over time helps users realize that tasks often feel better once started, helping to reframe their inner dialogue. Users gain emotional insight and learn to recognize unhelpful thought patterns. Mental health professionals might see it as a self-reflective tool, and app developers can use the data to fine-tune engagement strategies.
